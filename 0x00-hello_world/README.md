This directory was created to hold my answers / submissions for the
0x00. C - Hello, World project of the ALX SE foundations program

0-preprocessor: The script uses the -E flag with the gcc compiler to stop the
compilation process after the preprocessing stage. It also uses the -o flag to
move the output to a file called c

1-compiler: The script uses the -c flag with the gcc compiler to stop the
compilation process before the linking stage. By default, the output is placed
in a file of the same name as the source code file, but a .o extension

2-assembler: The script uses the -S flag with the gcc compiler to stop the
compilation process after the compiler finishes its work (generating
assembly code)
