This directory was created on Oct 27, 2023 to hold my answers/submissions for
the project '0x09.C - Static libraries' in ALX SE Foundations.

libmy.a - This library was created containing the object code for 20 functions
I implemented in previous projects. It was created using the ar command, which
already by default indexs the members, but I also ran the ranlib command just
for fun.
