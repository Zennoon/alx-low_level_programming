0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

0-memset-c: This function fills a given number of bytes of a given character
array with a given character. It is pretty straight forward. It uses the concept
of pointer arithmetic with a loop variable 'i' to set *(arr + i) to the required
character until the required number of bytes are filled.
