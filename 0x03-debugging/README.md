This directory was created to hold my answers / submissions for the project
0x03. C - Debugging in ALX SE Foundations. For this project, I have read the
resources concerning what debugging is (Finding and fixing issues / defects
in code that make it not execute / operate as intended), and one method of
manual debugging, which was Rubber Duck debuggind (explaining your code and
your problem to an inanimate object such as a rubber duck so that in the
process, you have a chance to look at your code with fresh eyes, and a new
perspective)
