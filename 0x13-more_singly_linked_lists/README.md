<h1>More Singly Linked Lists</h1>
This directory was created on Nov 20, 2023 to hold my answers/submissions for
the project '0x13. C - More singly linked lists' of ALX SE Foundations.

Singly Linked List: is a data structure that is linear (data items organized
linearly / sequentially), and dynamic (size can be altered at runtime).
Linked lists operate on the idea of nodes which are elements of the list
containing value, and pointer/s to adjacent nodes. In the case of singly
linked lists, each node contains value and a pointer to the next node in
the list.

<h3>Tasks</h3>
0-print_listint.c: The function receives a pointer to a singly linked list,
and prints the value (integer) stored in each node of the list. It returns
the number of (non NULL) nodes in the list.

1-listint_len.c: Given a head of a singly linked list, the function returns
the number of nodes/elements in the linked list using the fact that the last
node has its next pointer pointing to NULL.

2-add_nodeint.c: The function accepts a pointer to the head of a linked list,
and an integer value, and it creates and adds a new node to the beginning of
the linked list, initializing its n with the given integer value.
