This directory was created in Oct 16, 2023 to hold my submissions for the
project '0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings'.

0-reset_to_98.c: This file uses the concept of pointers. Pointers are variables
that hold the address in memory of another variable using the reference
operator (&). Then, using the dereference operator (*), we can access and
modify the value stored in the address which a pointer points to. This can be
used to pass arguments to functions by reference, so that the function can
modify these arguments.
