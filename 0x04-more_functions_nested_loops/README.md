This directory was created to hold my answers / submissions for the project
0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops in ALX SE Foundations.

This project was the continuation of the functions and nested loops project
which revolves around the concept of using functions to modularize our program,
and make it easier to read, write, and understand. Also, it touched on how to
use function prototypes, along with user defined Header files. Additionally, the
project also contained the concept of nested loops (basically loops within
loops).
