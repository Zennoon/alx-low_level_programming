0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

0-positive_or_negative: The code first generates a random number, then,
if...else if...else statement is used to decide if the number is positive,
negative, or 0. Then, a message is printed accordingly

1-last_digit.c: The code generates a random number, then the modulo operator is
used to get the last digit of the number. Then, a message is printed depending
on the value of that last digit using an if...else if...else statement

2-print_alphabet.c: The code uses the fact that chars are just integers, and
uses a while loop to print a character and then increment its value to the next
character until 'z' is printed. Then, an additional putchar is used to print
a new line.
